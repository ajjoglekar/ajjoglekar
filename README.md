# Hi there 👋 I’m Ajay

**Release Engineering • Release Management • DevOps (Practitioner)**

I’m a results-oriented Release Engineer with deep experience in **enterprise-scale release management and deployment orchestration**, and a growing hands-on focus on modern DevOps and cloud-native delivery practices.

My passion lies in bringing **structure, predictability, and reliability** to software releases — turning large-scale, complex deployments into **controlled, repeatable, and auditable delivery processes**.

## 🧭 Release Management & Deployment Experience

I come from a strong **Release Management / Release Engineering** background, where I owned and coordinated **end-to-end deployments across enterprise environments**.

A major part of my role involved **Octopus Deploy**, where I handled **release and deployment management for 400+ enterprise applications and microservices**, including both application and infrastructure components.

My responsibilities included:

- Managing **enterprise-wide deployment releases** across hundreds of applications and microservices  
- Designing and maintaining **multi-environment deployment models** (DEV → QA → UAT → PROD)  
- End-to-end **release planning, scheduling, and coordination** across teams  
- Environment setup, configuration, and standardization  
- **Octopus Deploy administration**, including:
  - Project and environment configuration  
  - Tenant and variable management  
  - Lifecycle and permission management  
  - Infrastructure and worker configuration  
- Integrating **Octopus Deploy with Azure DevOps** for automated deployments  
- Planning and governing **end-to-end deployment pipelines** from build to production  
- Supporting **infrastructure deployments** alongside application releases  
- Improving deployment visibility, consistency, and release confidence  
- Integrating deployment workflows with **ServiceNow** for change tracking and approvals  

This experience shaped my strong focus on **release governance, deployment safety, and operational clarity** in real-world enterprise systems.

## 📘 Continuous Learning & Growth

Alongside my release management expertise, I’m actively strengthening my **technical DevOps foundation** through focused learning and hands-on projects.

### 📚 Frameworks & Practices
- **SAFe Release Train Engineer (RTE)** — *currently studying*  
- **ITIL 4** — *currently studying (Service Value System, governance & practices)*  

### 🧪 Technical Skills (Actively Learning & Practicing)
- DevOps fundamentals and automation mindset  
- **Docker** (containerization concepts and usage)  
- **Kubernetes** (deployment models, environments, and scaling basics)  
- **Linux** (core OS concepts for production systems)  
- **Cloud fundamentals** (cloud infrastructure and delivery models)  

These learning tracks help me bridge **release governance and coordination** with **modern engineering-driven delivery systems**.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### **Hello-Deluxe**
A production-style CI/CD + GitOps learning project designed to reflect **how modern release systems should work** — not just how to deploy an app.

This project focuses on:
- Clear separation between build, deployment intent, and release verification  
- Git as the single source of truth for desired state  
- Kubernetes deployments driven by GitOps principles  
- Release visibility and explainability, not just automation  

👉 Repository and case study coming next.

## 🧠 How I Think About Releases

Reliable delivery is not just about speed — it’s about **confidence and control**.

I believe:
- Releases should be predictable, auditable, and explainable  
- Deployment pipelines must reflect real enterprise governance  
- Failures should be visible and recoverable  
- Release systems should serve both engineers and business stakeholders
