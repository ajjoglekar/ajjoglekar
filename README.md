# Hi there 👋 I’m Ajay

**Release Engineering • DevOps • CI/CD & GitOps (Practitioner)**

I’m a results-oriented Release Engineer with a strong foundation in Release Management and hands-on experience designing, operating, and improving enterprise-grade release pipelines and deployment automation.

I’m passionate about bringing **structure, predictability, and reliability** to software delivery — turning complex deployments into **repeatable, explainable release systems**.

## 🧭 Background & Experience

In my previous roles as a **Release Engineer / Release Coordinator / Release Analyst**, I worked at the intersection of development, operations, and governance to ensure releases were secure, compliant, and delivered on schedule.

A significant part of my experience involved **managing releases and infrastructure automation using Octopus Deploy**, where I:

- Designed and operated automated release pipelines  
- Managed multi-environment deployments (DEV → QA → UAT → PROD)  
- Improved environment consistency and deployment visibility  
- Integrated release workflows with **ServiceNow** for change tracking and approvals  
- Coordinated application and infrastructure releases across enterprise environments  

These experiences shaped how I think about **release safety**, **separation of concerns**, and **delivery confidence** in real-world systems.

## 🛠 What I Work On Today

- 📦 CI/CD Pipelines & Deployment Automation  
- 🔁 GitOps-based Delivery (declarative deployments, Argo CD)  
- 🧠 Environment Promotion Strategy (DEV → STG → PROD)  
- 🛡️ Release Safety, Rollbacks & Incident Awareness  
- 📊 Verification, Visibility & Release Confidence

## 📘 Continuous Learning

I actively invest in strengthening my systems and leadership perspective through formal study and hands-on projects:

- 📚 **SAFe Release Train Engineer (RTE)** — *currently studying*  
- 📚 **ITIL 4** — *currently studying (Service Value System, governance & practices)*  

These frameworks help me connect **technical delivery** with **enterprise-scale coordination, governance, and value flow**.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### **Hello-Deluxe**
A production-style CI/CD + GitOps system built as a learning-by-doing project to demonstrate **how modern releases should actually work**.

This project focuses on:
- Clear separation between build, deployment intent, and release verification  
- Git as the single source of truth for desired state  
- Kubernetes deployments driven by GitOps principles  
- Release visibility and explainability — not just automation  

👉 Repository and case study coming next.

## 🧠 How I Think About Releases

Reliable delivery isn’t just about speed — it’s about **confidence**.

I believe:
- CI should build artifacts, not control production  
- Deployments should be driven by versioned Git state  
- Failures should be visible, explainable, and reversible  
- Releases should be understandable to both engineers and stakeholders
